\section{2d exploration strategies}

Exploration algorithms can be grouped into centralized and decentralized. In the  centralized approach, each mobile robot receives tasks from a single central \emph{leader} which runs the overall planning algorithm, and afterwards the mobile robot sends its info back to the leader. Centralized assignment may be less practical due to communication limits (\cite{Dias2000}), robustness issues (\cite{Dias2006}), or time required for algorithm execution and scalability (\cite{Julia2012}). An advantage of centralized approach is that optimal plans can be found (\cite{Yan2011}). 

In contrast to centralized approaches, in a decentralized approach, the mobile robots are completely independent throughout the exploration process. Each mobile robot has its own local knowledge of the world and can decide its future actions by taking into account its current context and tasks, its own capacities and the capacities of the other mobile robots, through a negotiation process (\cite{Yan2013}). Moreover, it typically has better reliability, flexibility, adaptability and robustness (\cite{Zlot2002}). 
 
There are several representative approaches from the both centralized and decentralized groups described in the following text. 



\subsection{Nearest Frontier Approach}

	\label{fig:environment}
\end{figure}
An unexplored area is usually represented using an occupancy grid map introduced by \cite{Moravec}. While a robot moves, an occupancy likelihood for each cell of the grid is updated with the information of sensors. Depending on this occupancy likelihood, cells can be classified as free, occupied or unknown (Fig. \ref{fig:environment}). Using an occupancy grid a mobile robot can reach an unexplored zone navigating to the frontier cells that separate the free cells from the unknown cells known as \textit{frontiers} \cite{Yamauchi1997}. Yamauchi's technique consists in selecting the shortest path to the nearest frontier. In this way, the target cell selected by this technique $t_{NF}$ is:

\begin{equation}
t_{NF} = \argmin_{a \in F} L(a), 
\label{equation:t-nf}
\end{equation}

where $L(a)$ represents the length of the shortest path to reach the cell $a$ ($a_{i}$, $a_{j}$) and $F$ the subset of the frontier cells \cite{Julia2012}. As it can be noticed, (\ref{equation:t-nf}) only takes into account the cost of reaching a frontier cell and does not provide any coordination mechanism. In case a single mobile robot system is extended to a multi-robot system, mobile robots may select the same frontier if they are situated in nearby positions. For instance, \cite{Yamauchi1998} extended his nearest frontier approach to multiple mobile robots using global maps built by each robot with the information provided by all robots. Since mobile robots share the acquired information, exploration is cooperative, but mobile robot movements are uncoordinated. When the robots are in close positions it is likely that they choose the same frontier to explore if no other coordination mechanisms are considered.

Frontier exploration strategies are also extended to a multi-robot system in \cite{Simmons2000} and \cite{Burgard2005}. Simmons \cite{Simmons2000} used a semi-distributed model where a centralized module integrated local data from a team of mobile robots. The team used a probabilistic technique to build a global map in a coordinated fashion. Due to the problem of absolute positioning techniques in indoor environments, robots must estimate their local pose in an environment, leading to odometry errors. Simmons used probability calculations to estimate the local pose of each robot, and built a global map by joining each individual robots local map. 
While Simmons \cite{Simmons2000} implements coordination between robots by sharing of map information and reducing the utility of frontier points in the vicinity of an allotted point, Burgard \cite{Burgard2005} came up with an elegant bidding process. 

A dense frontier points detection method implemented by Orsulic (\cite{Orsulic2019}) is an extension to Google Cartographer (\cite{Hess2016}) that has achieved good results in terms of wall-time per frontier update, which greatly speeds up exploration process. Orsulic used nearest frontier approach in order to explore an area. 

Rekeleitis \cite{Rekeleitis2000} covered terrains with multiple robots where at least one robot was stationary and posed as an observer. In \cite{Fox2006} a decision theoretic approach to multi-robot exploration was presented where the main problem was to decide whether a mobile robot should explore the terrain or to verify the hypothesis of other robots whose states are not mapped into a common reference frame. The nearest unexplored region technique is also used by Wullschleger \cite{Wullschleger99}, Santosh \cite{Santosh2008}, Murphy and Newman \cite{Murphy2008}, to name a few more.


\subsection{Cost-Utility Approach}

Generally, in a cost-utility approach a goal point maximizes the benefit between cost and utility. The utility is measured in terms of the expectation of the information incorporated to the occupancy map from the position of the goal point. An example of cost-utility approach was presented by González-Baños and Latombe \cite{GonzlezBaos2002}. Frontier cells are designated as candidate destinations and the benefit $B_{CU}(a)$ to reach a candidate cell a is evaluated according to the following expression \cite{Julia2012}:
\begin{equation}
B_{CU}(a) = U(a) - \lambda_{CU}C(a),
\label{equation:cost-utility}
\end{equation}

where $U(a)$ is a utility function, $C(a)$ is a cost function and $\lambda$ is a constant that adjusts the relative importance between both factors. Utility and cost functions are expressions normalized in the range $\left[0, 1\right]$ that are calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
U(a) = \frac{U_{nex}(a, R_{s})}{\pi R_{s}^{2}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C(a) = \frac{L(a)}{max_{b \in F}L(b)},
\end{equation}

where the function $U_{nex}(a. R_{s})$ is the result of counting the number of unexplored cells in the range of the sensor from cell $d$, being $R_{s}$ the maximum range of the sensor expressed in cell units.
Then, the target cell $t_{CU}$ is chosen as the one that maximizes the utility-cost relation:

\begin{equation}
t_{CU} = \argmax_{a \in F} B_{CU}(a).
\end{equation}

Similar to the work proposed by Simmons, Burgard \cite{Burgard2000} introduced some coordination by means of reducing a determined initial utility given to each frontier depending on the likelihood of being in the sensor range from other frontiers that have been assigned to other robots. The assignment of frontiers to robots is made sequentially using a cost-utility approach with the length of the minimum path as cost. It is assumed that robots know each others relative positions. The algorithm determines optimal target points for each robot that increase the coverage by the maximum amount at that time period. Moreover, Burgard in \cite{Burgard2005} suggested that the assignment of frontiers to robots could be optimized using the Hungarian method \cite{Kuhn1955} instead of the sequential assignment.

Another example of cost-utility model is given in \cite{Umari2017}, where a frontier detection method is based on Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs). Umari defined revenue from a frontier point as a combination of an information gain and navigation cost. 


\subsection{Market-Based Coordinated Approach}

The general concept of the market-based approaches includes independence of robots in terms of planning, and the ability of robots to take team resources into account.
Relatively close to Burgard's approach in \cite{Burgard2000}, Zlot \cite{Zlot2002} uses a market architecture for the multi-robot mapping and exploration problem that aims to minimize an overall exploration time. In market-based coordinated approach each robot contains a list of goal points and profits associated with (\ref{equation:cost-utility}). Each robot selects the most profitable target as destination and when after reaching a current goal point, a robot initiates an auction. For each point in auction, each robot makes a bid with its current profit aiming to minimize own travel distance and maximize new area information.

It is shown in \cite{Dias2003} when different team sizes are included, a market method has an advantage over a centralized approach in terms of traveled distance. Authors in \cite{Zlot2002} 

Michael et al. \cite{Michael2008} proposed a marked-based coordination protocols where robots are able to bid for task assignment with the assumption that every robot has knowledge of the maximum number of robots that any given task can accommodate. Each auction is performed among neighboring groups of robots and requires only local communication.

\subsection{Decentralized Coordinated Approach}

Exploration strategies include algorithms for assigning robots to target points for environment exploration. Such algorithms can be grouped into centralized and decentralized algorithms. In the  centralized approach, each mobile robot receives tasks from a single central \emph{leader} which runs the overall planning algorithm, and afterwards the mobile robot sends its info back to the leader. Centralized assignment may be less practical due to communication limits \cite{Dias2000}, robustness issues \cite{Dias2006}, or time required for algorithm execution and scalability \cite{Julia2012}. An advantage of centralized approach is that optimal plans can be found in\cite{Yan2011}. 

In contrast to centralized approaches, in a decentralized approach, the mobile robots are completely independent throughout the exploration process. Each mobile robot has its own local knowledge of the world and can decide its future actions by taking into account its current context and tasks, its own capacities and the capacities of the other mobile robots, through a negotiation process (\cite{Yan2013}). Moreover, it typically has better reliability, flexibility, adaptability and robustness (\cite{Zlot2002}). 

Our approach is a hybrid one - the robots can independently decide towards which target point to navigate using an optimization procedure, while having common knowledge of all target frontier points and sharing information on their position and current goals.  our approach is hybrid and uses slightly different objective functions for frontier points assignment, which are a combination of frontier point cost, utility of reaching the target point and \textit{frontier occupancy function}. We also cluster frontier points to get a problem of manageable size and thus enable application of known optimization algorithms. 
Our approach is hybrid in a manner that target point assignment process and navigation are fully decentralized and event-based, that is, each robot team member makes an individual decision on the next target point each time it reaches the previous one. On the other side, SLAM extended with frontier detection and filter module are a centralized part of the exploration and mapping process.

Overview of the system is given in Fig. \ref{fig:exploration-strategy}. The system consists of a centralized part (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), frontier detection and frontier points filter), which runs on a dedicated computer and a decentralized part (Exploration strategy and navigation), which runs on each robot. In the following text each part is described separately.
