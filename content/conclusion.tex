\section{Conclusion and future work} \label{sec:conclusion}

The problem of autonomous environment exploration is complex, because it includes  control of a robot, environment scanning with a 3D sensor, creating of a volumetric-consistent scene in a common coordinate system from multiple views, the computation of the next view points to provide efficiently full coverage of the scene, {\color{green}an elimination of an occlusion na sto se tocno misli - pojasniti} under the constraint of minimizing the total path length between these points. 

In this paper, a brief overview of the 2D and 3D exploration strategies is given. 
%A modular approach to autonomous decentralized multi-robot exploration and mapping was presented. Even though the strategy achieved our expectations, the algorithm is open towards improving. Future research should consider decentralized map creating. Also, a significant improvement to this strategy would be a simpler simulator, that would allow for simulation of more robots.

\st{Another} {\color{red}Given this state-of-the art overview, one} research direction can be an extension to the 3D space including multi aerial vehicles (MAVs) algorithm to cope with a limited communication range of the mobile robots. Future work should also consider a multi-robot system which uses a (not fully) connected communication graph. Finally, we would like to take into consideration scenarios in which the robots may fail as well as time-varying environment scenarios.

This paper presents a solution to autonomously explore 3D environment without requiring an initial map or goal point. Octomap itself is able to handle dynamic environments by updating the map which makes the algorithm works well in dynamic environment as the point cloud is extracted from it.

This work is a stepping stone for new research in multi-robot exploration algorithms and its decentralization. There is also huge opportunity in 3D mapping and exploration, since ...
