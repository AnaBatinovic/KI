\section{3D exploration strategies}

In contrast to 2D exploration and mapping strategies, mapping of large environments in 3D requires high memory and
computational consumptions. 
Different autonomous 3D exploration strategies were proposed so that 2D
exploration tools are used to three dimensions. In \cite{Joho2007}, Joho et al. presented an exploration strategy that extends the known 2D exploration strategies into the 3D space. Mapping is done using multi-level surface maps while a cost function takes
into account an expected information gain and a travel cost. 
Bachrach et
al. \cite{Bachrach2009} presented a solution for enabling a quadrotor helicopter to
autonomously explore and map unstructured indoor environments. Authors useed a 2D frontier-based exploration algorithm and set a fixed altitude for the helicopter
during exploration.  

Dornhege and Kleiner \cite{Dornhege2013} used a frontier based method extended to 3D exploration. This method requires high computational effort and operating environment is limited to small workspaces. On the other hand, Maurovic et al. \cite{Maurovic2014} presented a 3D exploration strategy for a mobile
robot equipped with a 3D laser scanner. This strategy ensures an on-line room detection algorithm focused on the room-by-room exploration keeping the memory and computational
requirements low.

Next-best-view approach in the process of building 3D model of a real object used without any a priori information about the environment was described in \cite{VasquezGomez2014}. The algorithm determines each view to reconstruct an arbitrary object. Furthermore, authors proposed a method to deal with the uncertainty in sensor positioning.
Next-best-view approach for 3D exploration was presented by Bircher et. al. \cite{Bircher2016}. Authors presented a novel path planning algorithm for the autonomous exploration of an unknown area. The proposed planner finds the best branch in an on-line computed tree. The quality of the branch is determined by the amount of unmapped space that can be explored. The planner is capable of running online, onboard a robot with limited resources.

Baiming et al. \cite{Baiming2018} presented a new target points based trajectory planning algorithm to explore unknown space. The proposed method progressively plans long-term target point, intermediate target point, local target points,
and local trajectory within real time constraint. By tracking the trajectory, robot can efficiently explore the unknown space while avoiding obstacles.

Zhu et al. \cite{Zhu2015} developed a vision-based tool that performs autonomous exploration using an MAV equipped with 3D sensors. A real time frontier based exploration strategy is used to build maps that are stored in the OctoMap format (Fig. \ref{fig:octomap}).

Continuous cells are gathered into clusters and representative cells are chosen for each cluster. An evaluation function is used to choose the best representative cell and only state-changed space in the 3D map is processed in each iteration.
Authors in \cite{Senarathne2016} presened an alternative approach to 3D
exploration based on surface frontier voxels. The strategy focuses on seeking the expansion of mapped surfaces, instead of reducing unmapped voxels. 

Vutetakis in \cite{Vutetakis2019} proposed a novel startegy for inspecting
critical infrastructure autonomously using Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV). In order to facilitate autonomous inspection capabilities, this strategy address the problem of autonomous MAV exploration and coverage of an unknown structure to acquire the spatial information necessary for the development of a high-fidelity 3D model of the structure. Key to this problem is to not only cover the entire structure, but also to minimize accumulative data errors during the exploration through direct planning of loop closures. 

Rocha et al. \cite{Rocha2005} dealt with 3D mapping by multi robots using cubic cells for information storage. Authors presented a technique which is used for frontier-based exploration. At the beginning of the exploration an initial map is given to the robot, the robots updates old map by new set information which calculate by measurement and shares their useful information with other robots. The process is repeated until whole area is explored and mapped.

The 3D exploration problem using aerial vehicles within limited flight endurance was addressed by Wang et al. \cite{Wang2019}. Authors proposed an information potential field based method considering both the traveled cost and information-gain. The next-best-view point is chosen based on a multi-objective function which considers information of several candidate regions and the traveled path cost. The selected goal
attracts the robot while known obstacles form the repulsive
force repel the robot.

Autonomous navigation is highly important in
robotics, especially when it comes to the robotic applications in
disaster management etc. There are many algorithms to implement autonomous navigation and most of them are dependent on
prior knowledge of the environment and apriori maps. Although
they are effective in some scenarios, these algorithms fail to
perform when the environment has been subjected to changes
that might invalidate the prior map. This paper presents a point
cloud based algorithm which can be used in a situation where
the prior knowledge of the environment is highly inaccurate. The
proposed algorithm uses depth images to get a local map, which
it expands by searching for uncharted areas picking the next best
location to explore using a breadth first approach given a set of
constraints. The proposed algorithm exploits the maps in the 3D
space allowing the navigation system to perform effectively in
uneven terrains and use inclined planes for its advantage

\cite{Wang2018}
In this paper, we study the problem of autonomous
exploration in unknown indoor environments using mobile
robot. We use mutual information (MI) to evaluate the information the robot would get at a certain location. In order to
get the most informative sensing location, we first propose a
sampling method that can get random sensing patches in free
space. Each sensing patch is extended to informative locations
to collect information with true values. Then we use Gaussian
Markov Random Fields (GMRF) to model the distribution of
MI in environment. Compared with the traditional methods that
employ Gaussian Process (GP) model, GMRF is more efficient.
MI of every sensing location can be estimated using the training
sample patches and the established GMRF model. We utilize an
efficient computation algorithm to estimate the GMRF model
hyperparameters so as to speed up the computation. Besides
the information gain of the candidates regions, the path cost is
also considered in this work. We propose a utility function that
can balance the path cost and the information gain the robot
would collect. We tested our algorithm in both simulated and
real experiment. The experiment results demonstrate that our
proposed method can explore the environment efficiently with
relatively shorter path length.
